Furniture Store Inventory Management System

This is Milestone 1, where the object is to start a prototype for an inventory management system. 
What is included in this repository is the UML diagram for a basic item setup, a lo-fidelity flowchart to demonstrate the flow of interactions,
and a hi-fidelity demonstration of the inventory management system that is still a WIP.
